# Contributing to YouTube Transcript Automation

Thanks for your interest in contributing! 🚀  
This project is still experimental and we’re looking for help to make it **cross-platform** and easier to use.

---

## 💡 Ideas for Contributions
- **Python version**: Replace AutoHotkey with a Python script using:
  - `selenium` or `playwright` to control Chrome
  - `pyautogui` for cross-platform mouse automation
  - `youtube-transcript-api` for direct transcript fetching (where available)
- **Mac/Linux support**: The current `.ahk` script is Windows-only.
- **UI improvements**: Enhance the HTML dashboard with drag-and-drop file support or export options.
- **Packaging**: Bundle as a desktop app (Electron, PyInstaller, or similar).
- **Error handling**: Improve resilience when a video has no transcript.
